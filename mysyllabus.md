# How to Disappear

by **Nobody**

## Step 1

*Preparation*

First, understand why you want to disappear. Having a clear understanding of your motivations will help you in your journey after disappearing. Take stock of your resources, especially those that will aid in the disappearance as well as your life afterwards.

Get rid of all any unecessary attachments. This applies to personal items of affection, relationships, and customs. Being disapeared is a jarring experience and feelings of attatchment will make the experience far more difficult. So, burn bridges and your belongings (if you so choose).

## Step 2
*Execution*

You have the option of how public your disapearance is - Do you wish to simply dissipate into the ether without a trace? Perhaps a single text message to a loved one to console or blame them is in order. You can also go all out and leave a complex system of riddles leading to an explanation of your disapearance that some way decide to follow.

*What ever you decide to do, stick with it.* Every time you fail to stick to your disapearance, its impact will decline with each sibsequent attempt and your perceived mental state will be deemed attention-hungry rather than totally mysterious.

## Step 3
*Your New (Un)life*

Being disapeared offers an escape from the world that you knew and offers entry into a totally new world of discovery. However, be aware that this new world can be harsh, lonely, and challenging. How well you fare will depend on your resources - both monetary and social. If you have a social network with other disapeared persons such as hackers, phreakers, squatters, and or communes, you can enter those communities temporarily and access support.
