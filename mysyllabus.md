git #The Best Ways to Disapear
** Nobody **

## Step 1

*Preparation*

Get rid of all any unecessary attachments. This applies to personal items of affection, relationships, and customs. Being disapeared is a jarring experience and feelings of attatchment will make the experience far more difficult. So, burn bridges and your belongings (if you so choose).

## Step 2
*Execution*

You have the option of how public your disapearance is - Do you wish to simply dissipate into the ether without a trace? Perhaps a single text message to a loved one to console or blame them is in order. You can also go all out and leave a complex system of riddles leading to an explanation of your disapearance that some way decide to follow.

*What ever you decide to do, stick with it.* Every time you fail to stick to your disapearance, its impact will decline with each sibsequent attempt and your perceived mental state will be deemed attention-hungry rather than totally mysterious.
